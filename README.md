# This app was built using Create-React-App
Extremely simple and generic Todo App. This was built merely to display my understanding of React, React hooks and basic JavaScript.

This app was built with the following:
1) React.js
2) React Hooks - useState and useReducer
3) React-bootstrap
4) Sass
5) Google fonts
6) Font awesome

# How to use:
1) Clone and Install
2) Type in a todo item and press enter or return
3) Once you've completed your item, click the trash can to remove
